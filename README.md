# Live Coding Challenge

In this challenge you will be asked to finish a simple React application that fetches giftcard listings and allows adding to and removing from a cart. We have supplied you with a mocked out `fetchListings` action.

Tasks:

- Fetch and render card listings
- Implement adding a listing to cart
- Implement removing the listing from cart

Guidelines:

- Remember to talk out loud about what you are doing and why.
- Show us what you know about best practices in JavaScript and React.
- Feel free to ask questions as you go.
- Finishing is not the priority.
